## The Knight's Tour
<p>

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.
The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 Ã— 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.
