## Pi calculation using the Monte Carlo simulation
The method used square with a inside circle. The x-Axis and y-Axis goes from -1 to 1 and the radio for the inside circle is 1. In order to approach this method you can formulate the questions <i>what is the probability of a any random number for a pair (x,y) will be inside the circle?</i> The relation between randon inside pair to the ouside of the circle provides an approximation of the Pi number.

## The Knight's Tour
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.
The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 Ã— 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

## Sort
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

### Bubble Sort
Thi is simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case time complexity is quite high.
### Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
